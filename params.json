{"name":"XbmcControllerJs","tagline":"JavaScript library that makes it easy to talk to XBMC via the JSON API using Websockets, with a fallback to the HTTP API.","body":"### Status / Version\r\nPre-alpha\r\n\r\n### Components\r\nXbmcControllerJs consists of 3 main components:\r\n\r\n* Xbmc.Controller\r\n* Xbmc.CachedQueries\r\n* Xbmc.WebSocketsApi / Xbmc.HttpApi (only volume notification can be subscribed to)\r\n\r\nTypically you will only need to use Xbmc/Controller, but it is possible to communicate with Xbmc.CachedQueries, Xbmc.WebSocketsApi or Xbmc.HttpApi directly.\r\n\r\nXbmc.Controller will attempt to use Web Sockets first. Web sockets allows for 2-way communications, so notifications for events will be instantaneous. In addition, Web Sockets supports will work cross domain requests - No more CORS errors! All major browsers now support Web Sockets. Even IE (since v10). See - http://caniuse.com/websockets\r\n\r\nHTTP API has to poll, so notifications will be delayed and have a higher overhead. In addition, each item needs to be individually polled for, and thus specifically implemented. As such, the HTTP API only supports a small set of notifications.\r\n\r\n#### Xbmc.Controller (first upload pending)\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar xbmc = new Xbmc.Controller(); // automatically determines websockets or http\r\nxbmc.setMute(true); // helper command\r\nxbmc.Application.SetMute({mute:true}); // any RPC command can be run under the controller class\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Xbmc.WebSocketsApi & Xbmc.HttpApi\r\n\r\nBoth classes follow the same interface. The only difference between the two is the notifications that can be subscribed to.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar xbmcWs = new Xbmc.WebSockets({hostname:'192.168.0.10'}); // <-- XBMC IP or Hostname\r\nxbmcWs.subscribe('Application.OnVolumeChanged',onVolChanged);\r\nxbmcWs.call('Application.SetMute',{mute:true}); // <-- will cause onVolChanged to be called\r\nxbmcWs.unsubscribe('Application.OnVolumeChanged',onVolChanged);\r\n\r\nfunction onVolChanged(response) {\r\n    console.log('New volume is '+reponse.volume);\r\n    console.log('New mute is '+response.muted);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWritten by Den Williams (@denwilliams)\r\n\r\nWith a couple of snippets taken from the following projects:\r\n* https://github.com/bailus/XBMC-Simple-Remote - by @bailus\r\n* https://github.com/lucifurious/jquery-xbmc - by @lucifurious","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
