{"name":"XbmcControllerJs","tagline":"JavaScript library that makes it easy to talk to XBMC via the JSON API using Websockets, with a fallback to the HTTP API.","body":"### Components\r\nXbmcControllerJs consists of 3 main components/classes:\r\n\r\n* XbmcWebSocketsApi\r\n* XbmcHttpApi\r\n* XbmcController\r\n\r\nXbmcController uses the Api classes. Typically you will only need to use XbmcController, but it is possible to communicate with XbmcWebSocketsApi or XbmcHttpApi directly.\r\n\r\nXbmcController will attempt to use Web Sockets first. Web sockets allows for 2-way communications, so notifications for events will be instantaneous. In addition, Web Sockets supports will work cross domain! No more CORS errors.\r\n\r\nAll major browsers now support Web Sockets... even IE (since v10)! See - http://caniuse.com/websockets\r\n\r\nHTTP API has to poll, so notifications will be delayed and have a higher overhead. In addition, each item needs to be manually polled for. As such, the HTTP API only supports a small set of notifications.\r\n\r\n#### XbmcController (first upload pending)\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar xbmc = new XbmcController(); // automatically determines websockets or http\r\nxbmc.Application.SetMute({mute:true});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### XbmcWebSocketsApi & XbmcHttpApi\r\n\r\nBoth classes follow the same interface. The only difference between the two is the notifications that can be subscribed to.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar xbmcWs = new XbmcWebSockets({hostname:'192.168.0.10'}); // <-- XBMC IP or Hostname\r\nxbmcWs.subscribe('Application.OnVolumeChanged',onVolChanged);\r\nxbmcWs.call('Application.SetMute',{mute:true}); // <-- will cause onVolChanged to be called\r\nxbmcWs.unsubscribe('Application.OnVolumeChanged',onVolChanged);\r\n\r\nfunction onVolChanged(response) {\r\n    console.log('New volume is '+reponse.volume);\r\n    console.log('New mute is '+response.muted);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWritten by Den Williams (@denwilliams)\r\n\r\nWith a couple of snippets taken from the following projects:\r\n* https://github.com/bailus/XBMC-Simple-Remote - by (@bailus)\r\n* https://github.com/lucifurious/jquery-xbmc - by (@lucifurious)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
