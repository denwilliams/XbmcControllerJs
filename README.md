XbmcControllerJs
================

JavaScript library that makes it easy to talk to XBMC via the JSON API.

Check out the project site for more details: http://denwilliams.github.io/XbmcControllerJs/

Utilises Web Sockets for 2-way communication where available, with a fallback to HTTP.

HTTP API currently requires the JSON RPC 2.0 jQuery plugin (https://github.com/datagraph/jquery-jsonrpc), and subsequently jQuery. Later versions will be fully self contained.
